Its important to choose a license because its what makes an open-source project truly open source. There are many licenses listed but they all have the same 4 qualities: your free to run the program for any purpose, you can modify the software, you can redistribute the original copy, you can distribute your modified copy. When you put a license on your code, you allow people to use it in this way. Likewise, when you clone a repo with a license you are allowed all of this.

If you use code that does not have an explicit license, its technically not open source. This means you're not really allowed to clone it and modify or redistribute. The owner has an automatic copywright on it with all the protections granted, and you are not permitted to use it. Worse case you can get into legal trouble.

From what I read there are a few reasons why Gopher failed, they are: Gopher was not open-sourced, did not work with html, had paid licesnes, and got forked too often. I do agree with the reasons stated. Http was open to tinkering by the community, and as stated in the reading, there are always far more users than developers and these users also have incentive to modify the software because they use it. This lead to Http being developed way faster than Gopher, and that alone would have spelled the end of Gopher because it was simply a weaker technology.

From what I've read in an article by opensource.com, parts of the .Net framework went opensource years ago. According to this article, "The very nature of open source development is to accelerate technology, which is why competition today is so fierce and things move faster than ever before." So essentially, microsoft wanted to develop .Net more quickly. This is likely in response to Java and the Java Virtual Machine being the main opponent to C# and .Net.

We picked the MIT licnese

All licenses here are similar, but have subtle differences. For the common good the Apache license seems good, because it does not allow company trademarks and allowes sublicenses. GNU would be good for a company becuase it states the company is not liable for the use of the softwware, so they can not be sued if somoething goes worng with it. For a developer, all of the above would be beneficial, however I would use MIT because it is the simpliest and prevents against lawsuits. 

# 9  
First off, we would chose the MIT license simply because we are not lawyers and we can not read long and complex legal documents. The MIT license is simple and essentially says people can do anything with the software as long as they dont sue. We have decided that we want to code some type of extension for firefox. We have in mind a youtube video player that appears in a window that you could drag around a screen without borders.
